# Selenium Template

A basic Selenium setup to jumpstart new projects. Uses minimal testing frameworks.

## .env

* To setup: Make a copy of the `.env.template` file and name it `.env`
* The .env file is for user-specific configurations and also for secrets. Therefore it is NOT version controlled.

## Headless

You can set the tests to run in headless mode via the `.env` file

NOTE: Currently we are only supporting headless for Chrome
